 * Features included:
 *
 *  - Gaussian and Poissonian white noise
 *  - dichotomous noise
 *  - exponential Poissonian kicks amplitude distribution
 *  - simplified weak order 1.0 regular euler-maruyama scheme
 *  - simplified weak order 2.0 adapted predictor-corrector scheme
 *  - asymptotic long time average velocity <<v>>, <<v^2>> and asymptotic: exponent of the fractional moment q\nu(q), diffusion coefficient D
 *  - bifurcation diagram of attractors and accompanying velocities
 *  - basins of position and velocity attraction
 *  - the final position x and velocity v of all paths for histogram generation
 *  - ensemble averaged trajectory <x>(t), <v>(t) and <x^2>(t), <v^2>(t) as well as the time dependent fractional moment together with its exponent qnu(q)
 *  - velocity autocorrelation function and its power spectrum
 *  - avoidance of the run time limit on kernels by splitting the main kernel into smaller parts
 *  - path parameters folding for utilization of single precision arithmetics
 *  - scan over multiple values of the system parameters in a single kernel call
 *  - simultaneous scan over two system parameters
 *
 * TO DO:
 *
 *  - different Poissonian kicks amplitude distribution
 *  - recode command line parsing for use of less options
